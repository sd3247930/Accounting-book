# Vision Helper

The current model may not support native image input. When the user provides an image path or URL, do not rely on viewing the image directly. Instead run:

```bash
node "<项目根目录>\.codex\skills\claude-vision-skill\vision.js" "<absolute image path>" "<prompt>"
```

For an image URL:

```bash
node "<项目根目录>\.codex\skills\claude-vision-skill\vision.js" --url "<image url>" "<prompt>"
```

When the user pastes an image into the chat but no file path or URL is visible:

```bash
node "<项目根目录>\.codex\skills\claude-vision-skill\vision.js" --clipboard "<prompt>"
```

`--clipboard` reads the current image from the system clipboard (macOS uses a bundled Swift helper, Windows uses a bundled PowerShell script; the pasted image is usually still there). If it fails, ask the user to save the image to a file and provide the absolute path.

Fallback rules (automatic):

- If a local path is given but the file does not exist, vision.js automatically falls back to the clipboard.
- If no image path or URL is given at all, vision.js automatically tries the clipboard.
- Pass `--no-fallback` to disable this behavior and fail with an explicit error instead.

Rules:

- Always use the absolute path to `vision.js`.
- Use an absolute image path for local files, or `--url` for remote images.
- Prefer `--clipboard` when the user pasted an image with no accessible path.
- Use Chinese for descriptions unless the user asks otherwise.
- Configuration lives in `.env` next to `vision.js` (`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `VISION_MODEL`, `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`). Never print or commit the API key.
- If the API call fails, report the error to the user and ask them to check the key, model, or base URL.
